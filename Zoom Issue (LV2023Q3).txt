Steps to reproduce:
1. Open and run "Zoom Issue (LV2023Q3).vi"
2. Close the VI, then reopen it.
    - Note the tree label is now in Chinese characters
3. On the block diagram zoom to 150% (ctrl + 8 mouse-wheel clicks up)
    - All label text becomes Chinese. Interestingly the UTF-16BE encoded text in the string array is rendered as unicode.
